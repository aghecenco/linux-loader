/// guest memory at the user-specified addresses. It's meant to be called after the kernel is
/// loaded and after the boot parameters are built externally (in the VMM).
///
/// This trait will be extended with additional functionality to build boot parameters.

    /// The arguments are split into `header` and `sections` to accommodate different boot
    /// protocols like Linux boot and PVH. In Linux boot, the e820 map could be considered as
    /// `sections`, but it's already encapsulated in the `boot_params` and thus all the boot
    /// parameters are passed through a single struct. In PVH, the memory map table is separated
    /// from the `hvm_start_info` struct, therefore it's passed separately.

    /// * `header` - header section of the boot parameters and address where to write it in guest
    ///              memory. The first element must be a POD struct that implements [`ByteValued`].
    ///              For the Linux protocol it's the [`boot_params`] struct, and for PVH the
    ///             [`hvm_start_info`] struct.
    /// * `sections` - vector of sections that compose the boot parameters and address where to
    ///                write them in guest memory. Unused for the Linux protocol. For PVH, it's the
    ///                memory map table represented as a vector of [`hvm_memmap_table_entry`]. Must
    ///                be a `Vec` of POD data structs that implement [`ByteValued`].
